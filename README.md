This repository contains a MATLAB implementation for the SFPO-KPCA algorithm, authored by J.B.O. Souza Filho and
P.S.R. Diniz.

The SFPO-KPCA algorith is fully implemented in the function [f_SFPO_KPCA_greedy].

There is also a script [Sim_f_SFPO_KPCA_greedy.m] that illustrates how to set SFPO-KPCA parameters for extracting KPCA on 
a subsample of the USPS dataset.

The current implementation version is 1.0 - June 2024

The code is free of charge for non-comercial usage. Please cite our article in case of using our code.
